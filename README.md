# Order-Testing
 A website that manages orders using node.js. It uses MongoDB as its database to store all of its orders in collections, and Mongoose to build the schemas for orders.
 
To run the site, clone this repository, then open a terminal for node. Then run the line "node app" or "nodemon app" in the terminal; you'll have to run the site at localhost:5000 on your browser.
